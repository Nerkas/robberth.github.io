By now, you probably already have guessed my name. If not, look up at the
address bar in your browser. Knowing that, I am basically a student with lots
of hobbies and interests. First of all, I have chosen to study engineering
at KU Leuven (which is great, by the way!) and as major and minor I chose
electronics and computer science respectively. Fortunately, that is also where my fields of
interest lay. I love tinkering around with my arduinos and that often goes hand
in hand with basic programming, and I also like webdesign. Most of my love for
arduino started when I entered uni, and went to my first Soir√©e Pratique. That's
an event organised by IEEE's student branch Leuven, where older guys (masters and
doctorandi) gather to explain basic electronics to newbies (like me at the time).
There, I bought my first arduino and started tinkering at home. By now, my desk
is full of electronics and I have finished a couple of nice projects. I'm still learning
a lot, but all the work has started to pay off. Besides that, sometimes I leave my computer
for what it is and go running, biking or swimming. And I am also active in several
extracurricular groups, such as VTK Revue, Sagio and AFT.
