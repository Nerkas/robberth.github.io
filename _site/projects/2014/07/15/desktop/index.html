  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In the summer of 2012, I decided to build my own pc. It would be an AMD build,
because they are cheaper than Intel. It was about €650 at the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: AMD FX-6300 @ 3.5GHz</li>
<li>MOBO: AsRock 970 Extreme 3</li>
<li>PSU: Sharkoon WPM500 500W</li>
<li>HDD: Seagate 1TB 7200rpm</li>
<li>SSD: Samsung 840 EVO 64GB</li>
<li>GPU: Club3D Radeon HD7770 1GB</li>
<li>RAM: 2x 4GB Corsair Vengeance 1600Mhz</li>
<li>Case: Sharkoon T9</li>
</ul>

<p>I ordered all of the components online, and when they arrived a week later, I
was super excited to get my hands on it. It was super easy and a lot of fun to do.
Just follow some tutorial on the interwebs, connect some wires, hope that nothing is damaged and BAM, there’s your superfast, supercheap self-built computer.
Having the computer for over three years now, I am very satisfied with it. It boots
quickly (thanks to the small SSD) and runs smoothly. I only had a few crashes, but
the hardest thing I ever had to do, was taking the RAM out and put it back in.
The only issue I have had with it, is the loudness of the GPU fan, it’s almost like an airplane taking off. To fix that, I installed TriXx GPU tweak tool to enhance the fan speed, and now everything is quiet.</p>
