<h2>Background</h2>
I was bored during summer vacations, so I decided to do my first DIY project.
I went ahead and bought a road bike. I was able to get my hands on an old one for just
€50. I wanted to color it almost entirely black with just a few fluoresecent yellow accents on it.
I even made a drawing before coloring it:
<<< YET TO COME >>>
So that was the idea, but when we went to the shop, the fluorescent yellow paint
turned out to be really expensive, so I decided to buy only one can. It was not sufficient,
so I ended up replacing the color for some light green, spending a total of another €50
on paint, coating and cleaning product. <!-- TODO: coating?  -->

I guess the pictures tell the story better than I can:
