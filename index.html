Well hello, this is my website! I will mostly use it for blogging about my
projects, which you can find here: <a href="/projects">projects page</a>.
In the <a href="/about">about</a> section you will find out more about who I am
and what I do. Enjoy yourself, and if you have any questions or suggestions,
make sure to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>! Cheers! <br> <br>

<h1 class="page-heading"> This website </h1>
I am thinking about removing this "Home" page, as there is very little information
on it and just serves as an index.html page. You may also expect some major changes
during the following months, as I am doing a complete redesign from scratch. This is
actually just a temporary website.


  <!-- <h1 class="page-heading">Projects</h1>

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li>
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </h2>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul> -->

 <!-- does anyone still use RSS?
 <p class="rss-subscribe">subscribe <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">via RSS</a></p>
-->
