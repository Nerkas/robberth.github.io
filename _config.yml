  Personal site of Robbert Hofman. <br>
    I also never use Twitter but I thought it would look nice in my footer.
# baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
# url: "http://yourdomain.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
twitter_username: SmoothSwitch
github_username:  robberth

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown

collections:
   - lifequestions
include: ['_lifequestions']


 # All the variables set via the command line and your _config.yml are available
 #  through the site variable. For example, if you have url: http://mysite.com
 #  in your configuration file, then in your Posts and Pages it will be stored in
 #  site.url. Jekyll does not parse changes to _config.yml in watch mode, you must
 #   restart Jekyll to see changes to variables.
